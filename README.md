Deep learning based classification model for classifying toxic comments built on top of tensorflow

## Installation:
* Simply run the command ***pip install -r requirements.txt*** to install the necessary dependencies.
* In case you need to use your GPU for computation, ensure that you have the right CUDA drivers and CUDNN installed. You can read more about this [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu)

## Usage:
1. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and simply run the command: 
```
jupyter notebook
```
2. This will launch the jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) in your web browser. Simply hit `Shift+Enter` to execute all the cells.
