# DL based toxic comments classification ðŸ¤¬ [![Project Status: Active](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prateek-Ralhan-brightgreen.svg?colorB=ff0000)](https://prateekralhan.github.io/)
Deep learning based classification model for classifying toxic comments built on top of tensorflow

## Installation:
* Simply run the command ***pip install -r requirements.txt*** to install the necessary dependencies.
* In case you need to use your GPU for computation, ensure that you have the right CUDA drivers and CUDNN installed. You can read more about this [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu)

## Dataset:
The dataset has been taken from [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data)

## Usage:
1. Download the datasets from the above mentioned link and unzip them.
2. Clone this repository and create a directory named `dataset` in the same directory as the cloned repo. Your directory structure should look like this:

3. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and simply run the command: 
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. This will launch the jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) in your web browser. Simply hit `Shift+Enter` to execute all the cells. Your generated model will be saved in `models` directory.
